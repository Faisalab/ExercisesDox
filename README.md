# Exercises and Thoughts #
Hello, I had a great time doing these challenges. So, I did exercise one using two different types of styling, inline and internal. The corresponding files are named accordingly:

```html
inline.html
internal.html
```

Some of the fonts in the word doc were a bit tricky with regard to superscripts and whether they were also bolded. The superscripts looked different between the provided exercise file and the sample preview file. Ultimately, I saw the underlines were bolded in the sample so I followed accordingly.

### Here is a screenshot of the provided __exercise file__ ###

For the font sizing, I looked into the conversion of Microsoft Word pt to css units.
I also know Microsoft Word has some inner quirks like the spacing when creating bulleted lists, but I did my best to follow suit!

#### I very much appreciate the opportunity and sincerely hope to hear back!####
